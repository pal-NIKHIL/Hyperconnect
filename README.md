cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in the Express.js application.
dotenv: A module for loading environment variables from a .env file into the application's configuration.
helmet: A collection of middleware functions for securing Express.js applications by setting various HTTP headers.
jsonwebtoken: A library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT), used for user authentication and authorization.
morgan: A middleware for logging HTTP requests in the Express.js application.
multer: A middleware for handling file uploads in the Express.js application.
gridfs-stream: A library for working with MongoDB's GridFS, used for storing and retrieving files in the database.
Frontend:

React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router: A library for handling routing in the React application.
Redux: A state management library for managing the application's global state.
@reduxjs/toolkit: A set of tools and utilities for working with Redux, providing simplified state management.
react-redux: A library for integrating Redux with React components.
@mui/material: Material-UI is a popular React UI framework that provides a set of customizable and reusable components following the Material Design guidelines.
